            Allow yourself no more than 3 days to invite 2 or more partners to
            the project with which you will continue to work and interact.
            Choose partners with whom you will be comfortable going to a common
            goal. Study the project and its advantages (use open sources) so
            that your competence does not fail you. It is important that
            partners also follow these recommendations!
